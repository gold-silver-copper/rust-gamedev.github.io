<p>Welcome to the 50th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
<a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

<p>Hey everyone, it’s been a while! As you’ve certainly noticed, the newsletter has
been on hiatus for a while. The reason was mostly maintainer burnout, which is also
why the newsletter of August 2023 was not published <a href="https://gamedev.rs/news/049/">until a few days
ago</a>.</p>
<p>We’re back now though! A couple of community members, Jan Hohenheim
(<a href="https://github.com/janhohenheim">@janhohenheim</a>) and Thierry Berger (<a href="https://github.com/Vrixyz">@Vrixyz</a>), have led the revival of the
newsletter. This includes making changes requested by the community, and
improving sustainability for the long term.</p>
<p>You can read more about the changes being made in <a href="https://gamedev.rs/blog/newsletter-changes/">this blog
post</a>.</p>

<p>This restructuring is also a good time to improve the content of the newsletter.
We’ve got some community feedback on the <a href="https://discord.gg/game-development-in-rust-676678179678715904">Rust GameDev Discord</a> already
and would like to hear more from you. It would be great if you could fill out
<a href="https://forms.gle/oeSb46twWsxRKYJe7">this survey</a> to let us know how we can improve the newsletter going
forward. The survey closes on the <strong>28th of May</strong>. We will be evaluating the
<a href="https://forms.gle/oeSb46twWsxRKYJe7">survey</a> results in an upcoming blog post, so stay tuned for that.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Have fun reading!</p>

<p>The basic game logic and HUD are now complete, 
and the high-definition map for the demo is finished.</p>
<p>Some things are missing, like high-definition assets for soldiers or minimal AI for opponents.
But the <a href="https://github.com/buxx/OpenCombat/releases">demo is playable</a> and the team would love to hear your feedback!</p>

is a tiny coffee-break roguelike game, intended for short runs (ca. 15mins).</p>
<p>The gameplay is quite distilled and revolves mostly around resource management.
The player has limited inventory capacity and the weapons get damaged
after each use. There are 20 randomly generated levels to beat.</p>
<p>It is available on desktop (Windows / Linux), Android, and Web (mobile friendly).
The game’s source code also comes with a custom WGPU-based 2D framework.</p>

<p>This initial version features a main quest, side quests, items, and a boss fight.
Players can choose their favourite visual theme such as Zelda, Warcraft, and Fallout. The web version also supports mobile devices.</p>
<p>Although fairly simple, this first version provides a good foundation for building more features in later updates.</p>

<p>Bottomless-Pit is a 2d game engine written with WGPU that has been around for a year, which can be found on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bottomless-pit">crates.io</a> and <a href="https://github.com/EggShark/bottomless-pit">GitHub</a>.
Very recently a 2d camera was added as well as WASM and web support.
Current development is being focused on stability and QoL changes like texture sampling options and improved input.
You can check out several <a href="https://eggshark.dev/bp-examples">engine examples on the web</a>.
Since the engine is in its infancy, its developer calls for developers to use it and give the engine some feedback.</p>
<p>Current features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom Shader Support</li>
<li>Basic rendering</li>
<li>Text rendering</li>
<li>Input and window event handling</li>

<p>There are at least two, if not three, talks worth of material around how Bevy
progressively discloses complexity across multiple “stacks” of APIs; and the
work done so far is very impressive in terms of how it all fits together,
especially as a large-and-growing OSS project.</p>

Lucian has previously worked on <a href="https://github.com/SecondHalfGames/JoltC">JoltC</a>, a C API for Jolt, which this project uses in the background.</p>
<p>The bindings work can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/SecondHalfGames/jolt-rust">just-rust GitHub repo</a> GitHub repository and come in two flavors:</p>

This release has a strong focus on performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large performance improvement on various computations like rings and wedges</li>
<li>Add support for optimized storage for hexagonal and rhombus-shaped maps</li>
<li>Added support for rectiline path</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cBournhonesque/lightyear">lightyear_website</a> is a comprehensive networking library for bevy to make multiplayer games.
It comes with multiple types of transports (WebTransport, WebSocket, UDP, etc.) 
and supports replication techniques like client-side prediction, server interpolation, interest management, and more!
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/cBournhonesque/lightyear/tree/main/examples">examples</a>!</p>
<p>The latest release, <a href="https://github.com/cBournhonesque/lightyear/releases/tag/0.13.0">0.13</a>, brings two big new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steam support</strong>: you can now use the Steamworks SDK as your transport layer, which lets you use the Valve network!
Note that lightyear supports running multiple transports in parallel, so it’s possible to have cross-play between Steam and non-Steam users.</li>
<li><strong>Listen-server mode</strong>: it is now possible to run a server and a client in the same process/bevy app.
This can be useful to avoid the costs of a dedicated server, or to have a similar codebase between singleplayer and multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
